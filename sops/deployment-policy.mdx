title: '1.0 - STG Deployment Policy'

### STG Operations Model

With the redeployment of the Special Tactics Group, we face more scrutiny than other workgroups. To have a clear understanding of what we can and can’t do, all operators need to revise these policies and make sure we follow them.

**Deployment**

As a deployable workgroup, team leaders and commanders have a matrix or an operating guide to decide if a Tactical Response is needed for situations.

The STG Commander and the Commissioner of Police have overall discretion with deployments.

**Pre-Planned Deployment**

STG operator(s) may be deployed to events that have been planned, and a threat assessment has been carried out and submitted to the Commander or Team Leaders. This must be logged in the Deployment Channel.

Example of Planned operations:

- Non-threat or event operations (Open days, or other tasks)
- Request from AOS Command, DCC, or Police Leadership
- Any operation, event or request from an AOS Commander or STG Team Leader

Logging Format:

- \*STG [ROLE] ROLE DEPLOYMENT\*\*
- Emergency/Planned Deployment\*
- \*Auth:\*\* (Supervisor name)
- \*Time:\*\* 2000 HRS
- \*Incident:\*\* [Type of incident and summary]
- \*Location:\*\* [POSTAL, Road Name, City]
- \*Operators:\*\* [Those operators involved]

### **Emergency Deployment**

STG operator(s) may be deployed to events that require an urgent tactical response. This can be authorised by an STG Commander, Team Leader or AOS Command and the Commissioner of Police.

Example of events that require an emergency deployment:

- Active Armed Offender
- Hostage situations
- Large-scale threats and AOS staffing are not sufficient
- \*_ AOS Command defined as AOS Zero Alpha and Zero Bravo_

**Command at scene:**

During an event/scene where STG has been deployed, STG will provide a support role and assist where required, unless it has been established that STG will be in command and control or AOS presence is minimal; in such cases, an STG operator may assume tactical command.

### Application and Onboarding

**Application Review**

- Applications for STG are assessed jointly by STG Command and STG Team Leaders.
- Reviews will be conducted collaboratively and discussed when practical to ensure fair and balanced decision-making.

**Consideration will be given to:**

- Operational performance and experience.
- Discipline and conduct history.
- Teamwork, professionalism, and reliability.
- Dedication and activity within the wider Police structure.

**Selection Principles**

- Selection to STG is based on merit, capability, and conduct.
- Membership is a privilege, not a right.
- STG will not become a "closed group" or "boys’ club"; all applicants who meet the standards will be considered fairly.

**Onboarding**

**Successful applications will:**

- Be notified by STG Command.
- Receive induction and training modules tailored to STG operations.
- Be expected to familiarise themselves with all SOPs prior to operational deployment.
- Team Leaders will coordinate training and mentorship to ensure smooth integration into the unit.
